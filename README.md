Hello!

The general purpose of this is: I'm not always going crazy on code, but I like my github history to look complete. SO, I'm automating some simple commits to "fluff" my github. I hope that this project can evolve into something more substantial, but for now it's just analyzing randoms words and writing definitions.


Originally I was going to use an LLM to generate file contents, but that only worked when running individual jobs and not when running it automated.
Now I'm using a cron-job to execute my commands
